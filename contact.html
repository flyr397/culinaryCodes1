        <h2>"Thier Story"</h2>
        <p><center>In 2017 five complete strangers at Cleveland Codes Bootcamp, went <br/>
         from colleagues or peers, to very good friends. One day over lunch they began to converse<br />
         over how disstressed they were about the meals in which they were provided by a small cafeteria<br /> that was under construction
         and also a few vending machines that worked at their<br /> own discreation. As the conversation grew so did there awareness of how<br />  each one of
         them had such a descerning pallet for great food as well great conversation. Thus stands before
        you today,<br /> "Culinary Coders"<br /> The renowed Fine Wine and Dining establishment!</center></p>
