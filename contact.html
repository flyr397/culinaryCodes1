        "Their Story"
    
    </p>

    <p class="good">        

        In 2017 five complete strangers at Cleveland Codes Bootcamp, went <br />
        from colleagues or peers to very good friends. One day over lunch they began to converse<br />
        over how distressed they were about the meals in which they were provided by a small cafeteria<br /> that was under construction
        and also a few vending machines that worked at their<br /> own discretion. As the conversation grew so did their awareness of how<br />  each one of
        them had such a descerning pallet for<br /> great food as well as great conversation. Thus stands before
        you today,<br /> "Culinary Coders!"<br /> The renowed Fine Wine and Dining establishment.<br />
