        Winemaker's Notes : <br>
        Luminous gold with glimmers of pale green,
        the 2014 Wayfarer Chardonnay <br> booms with aromas of Meyer lemon,
        apricot blossom and heirloom apple,<br> echoed by notes of lemongrass,
        honeysuckle and butterscotch. <br> Generous flavors of sun-warmed
        white peach and crushed almond extend <br> long and wide on the palate  with
        a stunning underscore of wet stone <br>minerality. The mouthfeel offers both
        intricacy and wholeness, <br> it is soft and succulent, yet focused with
        sublime acidity. <br> A stunning wine to enjoy in its youth, it will <br> age
        beautifully for another 10-15 years. <br> $85

        Ravenswood Old Hill Ranch Zinfandel 2007 Sonoma's first <br> famous Zinfandel,
        made in 1862 by William Hill, was grown <br> in this vineyard.
        These vines-probably Sonoma's oldes-turn out  <br>remarkable wines.
        Old Hill Vineyard contains 14 different varieties, <br> blended to
        be 75% Zinfandel. It has Rhone-like intensity with <br> striking precise aromas
        of blackberry, black pepper, <br> vanilla, coffee, smoke, and mint. <br> $99

        Winemaker's Notes : <br>
        Duckhorn Three Palms Merlot 2013. The 2013 growing season <br>
        yielded a riveting expression of Three Palms Vineyard Merlot,
        with a rich <br> entry and pure and polished flavors of cherry,
        cassis, pomegranate, and <br> blackberry. On the palate, these
        gorgeous fruit elements mingle with complex <br> layers of leather,
        wet river rock, eucalyptus and black tea. Warm earthy notes finesse
        the finish while dense, fine-grained tannins provide wonderful length. <br> $89

        Winemaker's Notes : <br>
        Our 2012 Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon <br>
        is a lively and full-bodied expression of Alexander <br>
        Valley Cabernet Sauvignon from an exceptional vintage. <br>
        It has a lovely garnet color and opens with aromas of black currant,
        orange zest and raspberry. These aromas are framed by nuanced notes of
        vanilla, marshmallow and cocoa, eliciting an effect reminiscent of
        chocolate-covered berries. The attack is rich and gives way to a mid-palate
        with breadth and depth, supported with refreshing acidity and integrated,
        dusty tannins. This wine has power with an unusual vitality and
        structural balance. Given proper cellar conditions,
        this wine will provide drinking pleasure through 2034. <br> $75
